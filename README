For widgets:

1. Copy the arc-icon-theme/Arc folder into /usr/share/icons/
2. The volumebar-widget might not be visible because the top and bottom marging setting the bar width might be too big.
2.a. Edit the margins on line 33 and 34 of awesome-wm-widgets/volumebar-widget/volumebar.lua
2.b. Adjust them until the desired bar thickness is achieved
