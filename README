For locking:
1. Install either xscreensaver or light-locker
  a. light-locker only if you're using lightdm instead of gdm
2. Update the rc.lua to uncomment the key combo and the startup for the one you're using (light-locker vs xscreensaver)

Light-Locker will simply use the lightdm login screen, configure it accordingly.

xscreensaver is configured via xscreensaver-demo

For widgets:

1. Copy the arc-icon-theme/Arc folder into /usr/share/icons/
2. The volumebar-widget might not be visible because the top and bottom marging setting the bar width might be too big.
2.a. Edit the margins on line 33 and 34 of awesome-wm-widgets/volumebar-widget/volumebar.lua
2.b. Adjust them until the desired bar thickness is achieved

The battery icon can be used instead of xfce4-power-manager if desired, though it only reports status.  Uncomment the relevant lines in the WiBox
