For locking:
1. Install xscreensaver
2. Add the following command to ~/.xinitrc, creating it if it doesn't yet exist
	"xscreensaver --no-splash &"
3. The keybinding is running "xscreensaver-command -lock"

For widgets:

1. Copy the arc-icon-theme/Arc folder into /usr/share/icons/
2. The volumebar-widget might not be visible because the top and bottom marging setting the bar width might be too big.

2.b. Adjust them until the desired bar thickness is achieved
